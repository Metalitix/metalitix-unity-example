> 2. Press Play on the main Unity UI.  
> 3. While the project is running, find `LoggerHandler` object in the hierarchy window.
> 4. In the Inspector window of object `LoggerHandler` find script `ExampleMetalitixTrackerHandler`.
> 5. Right-click on this script or the three vertical dots above it. The dropdown menu will show Metalitix options (Start, End, Pause, Resume, Update, SetCustomField, RemoveCustomField, SetPollInterval, ShowSurvey). To run Metalitix, click the `Start` option.
> 6. Metalitix is now logging. You can view your session data on the Metalitix website.
